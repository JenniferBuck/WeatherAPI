Weather API
This is an API weather based website that will provide you with the current and 5 day forecast.  The user will enter a city name and the information will list.

The web url is https://jenniferbuck.github.io/WeatherAPI/.

My struggles on this homework were local storage and API.  I am anxious to keep working on this one so that I am able to add the weather emojis as well as the color change on the UV tab.
